To compile OKFS you need to have source code of Linux kernel you are using,
because OKFS uses definitions from kernel headers.
As for now OKFS works only on 2.6.* kernels and it was tested only on
 2.6.8 and 2.6.10.

1. Go to src dir
2. Change first line in Makefile (KERNEL_SOURCES=/usr/src/linux definition)
   to point to your kernel sources.
3. type 'make'
4. If compilation was successful run 'make check' to perform some testing.
