Tests here are checking correct behavior of programs running under the control
of OKFS. 

Files:
	testall.sh - script that runs all tests, and checks if they 
	succeed.
	
	*_test - Tests of general system calls like fork, wait etc.
	*_fs_test - Tests of filesystem calls, executed with ./localfs_test_dir
	mounted to /etc using localfs.

Coding convention:
	Successful test should exit without writing anything to stdin or 
stderr, otherwise it counts as failed.
